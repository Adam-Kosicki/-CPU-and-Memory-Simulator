# CPU-Memory-Project
 JAVA | Operating Systems, Computer Architecture

This project involved creating a simulated machine or computer using code to develop a CPU and Memory. The project was implemented with interrupts, processes, and a memory and CPU simulation. The memory has 2000 integer entries and supports read and write operations, and reads a specified input file with a program into its array. The CPU class keeps track of different modes like user and system, executes various operations, and handles logical and I/O commands. The processes were implemented using runtime.exec to call the memory class with arguments to determine the file's location. This project teaches programmers how hardware interacts and provides a better understanding of tools they use. Understanding how hardware works helps with debugging errors in code. The project was challenging, especially with processes, but it provided a great learning experience. The use of Java was preferred over C and C++ due to its simplicity in handling processes.
